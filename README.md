# 🌱 Launching Lag Sa Karas! — My Student-Made Task App 🎒
Yo  
After many late-night coding sessions (and a *lot* of coffee ☕), I’m so happy to finally share **Lag Sa Karas** with you—a project I built from scratch for students, by a student.
**Come play with it here:**  
👉 https://task-51525.bubbleapps.io/version-test/?debug_mode=true
***
### ✨ What does it do?
- Helps you organize tasks, deadlines, and projects
- Built-in Pomodoro timer (for those “let me focus 25min” bursts!)
- Email and popup reminders (manual. Guess who’s still fighting with automation…)
- Works on your phone & laptop  
- Made for students, but anyone can use it!
### 🙈 True story: What’s still missing (and why!)
- **Scheduled emails?**  
  I coded my own API, tried Railway, Make.com, even cron-job.org… but Bubble’s Basic plan just wouldn’t let me win (painful, but I learned so much!).
- **Automatic reminders and collaboration?**  
  Not yet! But on my wishlist—along with deeper analytics and file uploads.
- **Pomodoro only for logged in people.**  
  Security + progress tracking, you know 😎

### 🦾 Why share?  
I made Lag Sa Karas to help students like me, but I *seriously* need feedback from real users:
- Was it easy to use?
- Did you break it? (What happened? I want those bug stories!)
- What would make it more useful on your worst “deadline panic” day?
- Is Pomodoro enough? What do real students actually want for productivity?
- Want to collab or have ideas? Let’s chat!

### 🔍 For the nerds & builders:
- App: Bubble.io (No-code, lots of tinkering)
- Pomodoro: React + TypeScript (hosted on Vercel)
- API: Custom JavaScript attempt (Railway) — failed due to plan limits
- Learned: No-code ≠ no headaches, but *wow* you grow
***
### 🚨 Real talk:
- I’m now diving into IoT and robotics so updates might be slower (BUT—they’re coming! Weekly feature drops + bug fixes ☑️)
- Your feedback is what will shape the next version.
- I built this from pure curiosity + stubbornness. Looking for like-minded testers, students, code/design geeks, or anyone who just loves to try new things.
